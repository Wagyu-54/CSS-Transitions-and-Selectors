                <h2>Article 1: The Rise of the Spartans</h2>

                <p>
                    The Spartan program was created by the United Nations Space Command to defend humanity from growing threats.
                    Dr. Catherine Halsey selected gifted children and trained them to become elite soldiers.
                    Through intense augmentation and discipline, the Spartans became nearly unstoppable on the battlefield.

                <h2>Article 3: The Covenant Alliance</h2>

                <p>
                    The Covenant was a religious alliance of alien species united under false beliefs.
                    They believed the Forerunners were gods and that Halo rings would bring salvation.
                    This misunderstanding led to decades of brutal war against humanity.

                <h2>Article 4: The Halo Rings</h2>

                <p>
                    The Halo rings are massive superweapons built by the ancient Forerunners.
                    They were designed to eliminate all life capable of supporting the Flood.
                    Activating them would wipe out civilizations across the galaxy.

                <h2>Article 5: The Flood Threat</h2>

                <p>
                    The Flood is a parasitic life form that consumes and controls other organisms.
                    Once released, it spreads rapidly and becomes nearly impossible to contain.
                    Entire planets were lost attempting to stop its advance.

                <p>
                    The Forerunners were an advanced civilization that ruled the galaxy long before humans.
                    They possessed technology far beyond modern understanding.
                    Their downfall came when they sacrificed themselves to stop the Flood.

                <p>
                    Cortana was one of the most advanced artificial intelligences ever created.
                    She assisted Master Chief in countless missions.

                <p>
                    Reach was one of humanity’s most important military strongholds.
                    When the Covenant attacked, the planet was overwhelmed.
                    The heroic defense of Reach delayed the enemy long enough to save Earth.
